//6. Create a program that will determine how much a person pays for their yogurt at the new yogurt shop based on size of yogurt (in oz), toppings, coupon, sales tax and tip. The new yogurt shop charges $.17 per oz of yogurt and the cup is Â¼ of an oz.  Each topping costs $.50.  If the customer has a coupon they can take off between 10% and 50% of their costs.  Sales tax in Chico is 7.25% and a person can choose their own tip.  Output a receipt with ounces of yogurt without the cup, toppings costs, sales tax, discounts, and tip as well as the total fee to be paid.
