// Want to say: Today is Thursday, January 30th in the year 2020
//"Today is (day of the week in string data type), (current month in string data type) (current day of the month in integer data type)th in the year (current year in integer data type)"

//"Temperature" - 2  points
//Directions: Create a string variable that holds your home town name and a float variable that holds a temperature.  Output the "current" temperature.  Update your temperature with tomorrow's high temperature and output tomorrow's temperature.  Make sure you use appropriate verbiage to explain what we are seeing.

//Want to say: Oroville, California  64.0 degrees in Oroville, California  currently
// "(current temperature in float data type) in (City name in string data type) , (State name in string data type)"

//6. Create a program that will determine how much a person pays for their yogurt at the new yogurt shop based on size of yogurt (in oz), toppings, coupon, sales tax and tip. The new yogurt shop charges $.17 per oz of yogurt and the cup is Â¼ of an oz.  Each topping costs $.50.  If the customer has a coupon they can take of between 10% and 50% of their costs.  Sales tax in Chico is 7.25% and a person can choose their own tip.  Output a receipt with ounces of yogurt without the cup, toppings costs, sales tax, discounts, and tip as well as the total fee to be paid.
