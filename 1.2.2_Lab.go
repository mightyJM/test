//ASCII Art - 1 point
//Directions: Create ASCII Art (Links to an external site.) of your choice. At least 5 lines of code. Don't forget header comments.
//Want to draw a sad ice skating ballerina princess. 

//Execution of above follows:

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("            W")

fmt.Println("           J(   )P")  
fmt.Println("            MMMMM  ^")
fmt.Println("            |   |_ |   ")                
fmt.Println("            | ")
fmt.Println("            V  ")  
} 



//"Today" - 2 points: 
//Directions: Create two string variables that hold the current date of the week and month.  Create two integer variables that hold the current date and year.   Output an appropriate message of today's date (appropriate includes verbiage to explain what we are seeing).

// Want to say: Today is Thursday, January 30th in the year 2020
//"Today is (day of the week in string data type), (current month in string data type) (current day of the month in integer data type)th in the year (current year in integer data type)"

//Want to say: Today is the 30th of January, which is a Thursday in the year 2020. 
//"Today is the (current day of the month in integer data type)th of (current month in string data type), which is a (current day of the week in string data type) in the year (current year in integer form).""

//Want to say: 01 30 2020
//"(Integer value of current month with 0 preceding integers <10) (integer value of current date with 0 preceding integers <10) (Integer value of current year)

//Want to say: I want to do this another way but havent figured out how without commas or slash marks.
// 30 01 2020 ??


//"Temperature" - 2  points
//Directions: Create a string variable that holds your home town name and a float variable that holds a temperature.  Output the "current" temperature.  Update your temperature with tomorrow's high temperature and output tomorrow's temperature.  Make sure you use appropriate verbiage to explain what we are seeing.

//Want to say: Oroville, California  64.0 degrees in Oroville, California  currently
// "(current temperature in float data type) in (City name in string data type) , (State name in string data type)"
